# Demo app

This repo contains demo code written by Tim Poulsen @skypanther for the AT&T Western New York Civic App Challenge. There's a cross-platform mobile app built with Appcelerator&reg; Titanium&trade; and a NodeACS server-side API.

This demo showcases the:

 * Titanium cross-platform mobile app development platform
 * Alloy MVC-like framework
 * Add-on extension modules (platform-specific map modules)
 * Use of community-contributed widgets
 * NodeACS to create a cloud-based API that filters a large dataset making it mobile ready
